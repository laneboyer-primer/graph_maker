       "['\\nBilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir. \\nGandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the \\nDark Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, \\nbut fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee. \\nThey are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. \\nThe Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. \\nMerry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThey try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are \\ntrapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, \\nthey are caught by a barrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, \\nwho frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. The Hobbits reach the village of Bree,\\nwhere they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, \\nwhich identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, \\nStrider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. \\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nAt Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. \\nStrider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas. They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, \\nwho rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, \\nwhere they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. \\nGandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. \\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, \\nthe heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. \\nThe Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. \\nGandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The Council decides that the Ring must \\nbe destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. \\n\",\n",
       " '\\nElrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, \\nson of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples \\nof the West. After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through \\nthe Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and his Dwarves were killed by Orcs. \\nThey are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. \\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThe others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, \\nand gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, \\nthe Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her. \\nGaladriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down the \\nRiver Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. \\nFrodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts him.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nA party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. \\nBoromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. \\nAragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. \\nThe Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli and \\nLegolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too \\nwas killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman \\nas chief of the wizards. They ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees King Théoden from the influence \\nof Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep; \\nGandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. \\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe Ents destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. \\nGandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan \\nto Helm's Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. \\nGandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin \\nrelaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nWhen Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Wormtongue throws down a \\nhard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals \\nit in the night. It is a palantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared. \\nSauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, \\ntaking Pippin with him.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nFrodo and Sam struggle through the barren hills of the Emyn Muil. They realize they are being tracked; \\non a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to \\nserve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. \\nSam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to steal the Ring. \\nThe Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so they travel south through Ithilien to a secret pass \\nthat Gollum knows. They are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's brother, and brought to the \\nsecret fastness of Henneth Annûn. \",\n",
       " \"\\nFaramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying orders \\nto arrest strangers, releases them. Gollum guides the hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair \\nof the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo holds up his gift, the Phial of Galadriel, \\nwhich holds the light of Eärendil's star: it drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts through a giant web using his \\nsword Sting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam picks up Sting and the Phial. \\nHe wounds the monster. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. \\nOrcs take Frodo; Sam overhears them saying that Frodo is still alive.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, \\nwhile Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl \\nuses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He \\nburns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied \\nby Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, \\noathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. \\n\",\n",

He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs' ships \\nup the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden's niece Éowyn, \\nwho joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. \\nGondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Théoden is killed. \\nAragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to \\ndistract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nSam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of \\nthe Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer: he claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum \\nreappears. He bites off Frodo's Ring finger. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the \\nFire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power. All he created collapses, \\nthe Nazgûl perish, and Aragorn wins the battle of the Morannon. Aragorn is crowned King, and weds Arwen, Elrond's \\ndaughter.

Wray\\nIn testimony to the House Committee on Homeland Security on Nov. 15, 2022: “Iran and its global proxies and partners, including Iraqi Shia militant groups, continue to attack and plot against the United States and our allies throughout the Middle East in response to U.S. pressure. “And what's beginning to emerge is at least the beginnings of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran, with the Iranians supplying drones to the Russians, which are killing Ukrainian civilians as we speak today, and the Russians beginning to look at ways in which, technologically or technically, they can support the Iranians, which poses real threats to Iran's own neighborhood, to many of our friends and partners in Iran's neighborhood as well.\\n Today, after the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA and Iran, moving away from you know, its compliance with the agreement, enriching to 60 percent, resuming enrichment activities at Fordow, the nuclear site dug into--pretty deep into--a mountain in Iran, usually expanding the amount of the stockpile of enriched uranium that they have well beyond the constraints in the Comprehensive Nuclear Agreement, beginning to work again on advanced centrifuges which speed up their ability to enrich especially to higher levels as well, for all those things. The Iran-Russia increasing alliance, the proliferation of UAVs to Russia, and the possibility that there's contemplation of the transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine is both a call for the entire global community to step up, in how we counter the Iran threat, and very specifically to take a firm stance against Russian-Iranian cooperation.”\\n\",\n",
